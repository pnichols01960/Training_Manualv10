PURPOSE  To provide appropriate guidelines to all employees regarding attendance.    POLICY  Each employee is required to maintain acceptable attendance during their employment.  Employees are evaluated on their attendance as part of an overall performance expectations  and are expected to maintain acceptable attendance during their employment.    Employees attendance will be rated as either “Meets Expectations” or “Does Not Meet  Expectations” based on the number of unscheduled incidences away from work as described  below:         • 0 to 6 incidences of unscheduled absence = “Meets Expectations” attendance rating       • 6.5 or more incidences of unscheduled absence = “Does Not Meet Expectations”             attendance rating    A rating of “Meets Expectations” (up to 6 incidences in a rolling back 12 -month period) is  considered acceptable attendance. Failure to consistently meet and maintain this standard may  result in corrective action up to and including termination of employment. New employees with  less than 9 months of service may be placed on corrective action if unscheduled time becomes  excessive even if the number of incidences is fewer than 6. Example: Employee has been with  the company less than 2 months and has 5 incidences.    All unplanned time away from work, including but not limited to unplanned PTO as well as  unpaid time (except as noted above) will be counted toward attendance ratings unless the time  is part of an approved Family Medical Leave, or reasonable accommodation as described in  the respective policies.    Except for time off related to an approved leave of absence, employees may not take unpaid time  away from work when they have PTO available for use. If approved by department management  and Human Resources, planned/scheduled and approved unpaid time of up to 3 days in a  calendar year will not be counted for attendance purposes. Please note that the three days of  unpaid time is an exception due to extenuating circumstances that resulted in the employee  exhausting PTO and is not intended to augment an employee’s PTO bank.    3 PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL                                                                     PROPRIETARY & CONFID                                                                        NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures    Supervisors/Managers should consult with their Human Resources contact before approving  these types of requests.    Except for time off related to an approved leave of absence, an absence of one to two days will  be counted as one incident for this policy. Absences of three to five days will be counted as two  incidences. Absences of six to eight days will be counted as three incidences. Any absence  beyond eight days will be counted as 4 incidences.    0.5 hrs. – less than one full day absent  ½ incident of absence  Up to 2 consecutive days absent           1 incident of absence  3-5 days absent                           2 incidents of absence  6-8 days absent                           3 incidents of absence  Beyond 8 days absent                      4 incidents of absence    A late arrival, early departure or other shift interruption of thirty minutes or more will is  considered a ½ (one half) incident—this includes on-call shifts. For Non-Exempt employees,  only, when planned and approved 48 hrs. in advance, Make-Up time can eliminate an  incidence due to a late arrival or early departure.    Absences that occur in repetitive patterns such as before or after a holiday and before and after  a weekend can result in a “Does Not Meet Expectations” attendance rating. Patterns of 2 -day  or more absences may be addressed through corrective action. 6.5 or more incidences in any  12-month period may result in corrective action up to and including employment termination.    POLICY ENFORCEMENT  Falsification of company records, including time entry records, may result in corrective action up  to and including employment discharge. Inaccurate reporting o f PTO or unscheduled time used  or failure to report time used is falsification of company records. Department management, in  conjunction with Human Resources, investigates incidences of false reporting.    The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment based on mutual understanding,  respect and cooperation. No policy can be so specific as to spell out every possible scenario we  might face. Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold the highest standard of  integrity for ourselves and our company. We expect all employees to be guided by both the  letter and the spirit of this policy. Non-Compliance with this policy may result in corrective action  up to and including employment termination. The Company intends to honor this policy and th e  procedures set forth below but reserves the right to change them at any time, with or without  notice, at its sole discretion. Nothing in this policy alters our “at-will” employment policy. To the  extent there is a conflict between this policy and federal, state, or local law, the Company will  comply with applicable law.

Telecommuting may be appropriate for some employees and  positions but not for others and is not an entitlement or companywide benefit. The following policy and  procedures provide details on home- based work options. The telecommuting arrangement does not abridge the  “at will” relationship for the employee and Landmark Health.    GUIDELINES:    Definitions Related to Telecommuting  o Telecommuting Employee: An employee who works remotely in a home office or satellite location and does         not have a dedicated office space within the facility to which they report.  o Hoteling Employee: An employee who works remotely in a home office or satellite location and shares a         hoteling workstation with other employees at Landmark.

In                               addition to following physical precautions guidelines, staff should                               also be taking care of their psychological well-being and                               encouraging the same when talking with patients.

Tips for Staff & Patients    Reduce anxiety by reducing risk. Ways to reduce risk include:       • Practicing good hygiene, such as sneezing and coughing into your elbow,           sneezing into a tissue and immediately throwing the tissue away, washing hands           regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, etc.    11 PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL                                                                      PROPRIETARY & CONFID                                                                         NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures        • Creating a plan in case your regular routine is disrupted, such has setting up           remote work and alternative childcare arrangements. Setting out a plan can help           reduce anxiety by taking charge of the things you can control.    Manage your information flow by choosing reliable sources and establish boundaries on  checking for updates        • Getting regular, factual, information is important. However, continuously scrolling           through social media or constantly refreshing the news is likely to lead to           increased anxiety. Pick a few trusted news outlets – such as your state and local           health authorities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the World           Health Organization – and commit to checking them once or twice a day for           updates.    Monitor your anxiety levels        • Anxiety is a normal response to a stressful situation and can provide adaptive           benefits in many situations. However, when faced with mounting uncertainty,           your brain can go into an anxiety spiral that is no longer helpful. Knowing the           difference between typical and atypical stress is important. Monitoring your           stress level will let you know when you need to seek additional help.        • A typical stress reaction may include; temporary difficulty concentrating, irritability           and anger, fatigue, a stomachache, and/or difficulty sleeping.        • An atypical stress reaction may include a persistent and/or excessive worry that           doesn’t lift and keeps you from carrying out your daily activities, including work. If           you experience significant changes in your energy level, eating patterns, or           sleeping patterns, difficulty concentrating on normal tasks, prolonged and           overwhelming worry and hopelessness contact your community behavioral health           provider for further evaluation.    Practice good self-care, including:        • Exercise, Eating Healthy Foods      • Sleeping an Adequate Amount at Night.    If possible, spend some time outside. Avoid staying up late to  monitor the news.    Virtually reach out to different types of support networks, such as family, friends,  colleagues, faith-based communities, and social organizations to strengthen your  overall feeling of connection. Isolation and loneliness feeds anxiety.        • Find meaningful tasks and roles within your support network to channel your           anxiety, such as coordinating deliveries of groceries to those unable to leave           home, curating kids’ activity ideas for parents working from home, or video calling           or calling those who might feel socially isolated. Supporting others is beneficial to           the supporter as well.    PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL  12    PROPRIETARY & CONFID            NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures         • Find or create spaces that are not focused on COVID-19. Start a social media           thread about other topics, ask friends to discuss other topics, or watch your           favorite TV show or movie.         • Savor small positive moments, amplify positive stories, and stay optimistic. Try to           cultivate a mental wellness practice, such as writing in a gratitude journal, or           talking nightly with your family about moments during the day that were fun or           enjoyable.         • Take an opportunity to practice mindfulness. Mindfulness tools like grounding           exercises, sensory modulation, and deep breathing may be helpful.    Tips for Working with Patients with Behavioral Health Issues    Encourage the patient to think about helpful coping skills they have used in the past that  they can put into practice daily. For example:         • Listening to Music       • Walking Outside       • Reframing their Thoughts       • Connecting with others    If the patient indicates that they struggle with ruminating, self-injury, substance use, or  other strategies that might be harmful to their safety and well-being, encourage them to  identify alternative coping methods they can practice and to write out a plan to help  prepare for heightened anxiety.    Encourage the patient to seek positive peer support. Connect with others who  understand their experiences and can assist in problem-solving. If social distancing  increases feelings of isolation, encourage them to look into online peer supports or peer  hotlines such as, National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) https://www.nami.org/    Encourage the patient to follow-up with their established behavioral health provider if  currently connected to a provider in the community to develop a coping plan; if not, ask  if they would be open to a call from a Landmark Health social worker or behavioral  health provider who can educate them about managing anxiety and help them come up  with practical skills that can be rehearsed as well as provide alternative options if routine  services are disrupted. These might include:         • Using Telepsych Health Services       • Getting Prescription Medication       • Engaging in Supplemental Mental Wellness Activities    If patient expresses thoughts of self-injury or suicide, encourage that they seek out  immediate help by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255. If  the patient is an imminent risk for self-harm or harm to others, then call 911.    13 PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL                                                                      PROPRIETARY & CONFID                                                                         NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures    Tips to Share with Caregivers who are Supporting Patients    Encourage alternative ways for the patient to maintain social connections. As the elderly  have been told to isolate as much as possible, it is likely that social isolation and  loneliness may take a toll on physical and mental health. A few suggestions that support  social connects include:        • Setting up and providing technological assistance for family and friends to stay           connected to the patient        • Coordinating a group of family, friends, or neighbors to check in on the patient           (telephonically) on a rotation so that they feel the support of a network        • Encourage the patient to stay as active as possible, for both their physical and           psychological well-being.        • Encourage the patient find ways where they can help others, such as calling           others to check in on them or entertaining grandchildren on FaceTime. Having a           purpose and role can reduce anxiety.        • Consider practical ways you can relieve the patient’s anxiety, such as           volunteering to order their groceries online or offering to care for individual’s           pet(s).        • Curate a list of reputable media and write them down for the patient. In a time of           high anxiety, it may be hard for the individual to select reliable sources to get           information and updates on COVID-19.        • Practice self-care and be compassionate to yourself. While caregiving is a           demanding and rewarding role at the best of times, being a caregiver during           times of heightened concern is particularly stressful. If possible, find a way to           take small breaks, rotate responsibilities with others, and practice your own           behavioral health strategies.

Include a Clear, Direct Subject Line             • People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line             • Examples of a good subject line include \"Meeting date changed\" \"Quick               question about your presentation“ or \"Suggestions for the proposal“    2. Use Professional Email Addresses             • You should always use your company email address when sending               electronic communications concerns business matters.             • Never use company email addresses for non-busines related               conversations.    3. Refrain from Using the “Reply All” Button             • Your co-workers are very busy caring for the needs of our J/J’s. Most of us               try very hard to stay on top of reading all the emails that we receive daily.             • Don’t hit \"reply all\" unless you really think it is necessary.    4. Include a Signature Block    • Landmark standardizes company signature blocks. Employees should be      sure your signature block is consistent with company guidelines.

Use Professional Salutations                  • Using laid back, colloquial expressions like, \"Hey you guys,\" \"Yo,\" or \"Hi                    folks is discouraged in business-related communications.\"                  • Never shorten anyone's name. Say \"Hi Michael,\" unless you're certain he                    prefers to be called \"Mike.\"       6. Use Exclamation Points Sparingly                  • If you choose to use an exclamation                    point, use only one to convey                    excitement.                  • “Putting multiple exclamation points at                    the end of sentences can appear too                    emotional or immature.       7. Be Very Cautious with Humor                  • Humor can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial                    expressions. In a professional exchange, it's better to leave humor out of                    emails unless you know the recipient well.                  • Something perceived as funny when spoken may come across very                    differently when written. When in doubt, leave it out.\"       8. Your Emails Should Be “cross-cultural”                  • Know that people from different cultures speak and write differently.                    Miscommunication can easily occur because of cultural differences.                  • A good professional rule to use is, “When in doubt, refrain”.       9. Reply to All of Your Emails                  Even if the email wasn't intended for you.                  • It's difficult to reply to every email message sent to you, but you should try                    to.                  • This includes emails that are accidentally sent to you, especially if the                    sender is expecting a reply.                  \"I know you're very busy, but I don't think you meant to send this email to me,                and I wanted to let you know so you can send it to the correct person.\"    23 PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL                                                                      PROPRIETARY & CONFID                                                                         NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures     10. Proofread Every Message                 • Your mistakes won't go unnoticed by the recipients of your email.               • Don't rely on spell-checkers. Read and re-read your email a few times,                      preferably aloud, before sending it off.     11. Double-Check That You Have Selected the Correct        Recipient                 • Pay careful attention when typing a name from your address book on the                    email's \"To\" line. It's easy to select the wrong name, which can be                    embarrassing to you and to the person who receives the email by mistake.     12. Keep Your Font & Color Classic                 • For business correspondence, keep your fonts, colors, and sizes classic.                    Your emails should be easy for other people to read.                 • (10- or 12-pt) and fonts such as Calibri, or Times New Roman. As for                    color, black is the safest choice.                 “Did you know typing in RED communicates aggression”     13. Nothing in Electronic Form Is Ever Truly ‘Deleted’                 • Don't write anything that would be incriminating to you or hurtful to others.               • After all, email is dangerously easy to forward, and it's better to be safe                      than sorry.

Business Chat Etiquette       1. Instant Messaging                  • In a sense, sending a colleague an instant                    message over Skype or MS Teams is like knocking                    on the door of your contact’s virtual office.                  • Something like a “Hello. Is now a good time for a                    question?” is a quick and demure way to get our                    colleague’s attention and to allow them to politely                    defer, if necessary.         •    Hello. Is now a good time for a question?    2. Be Informal Without Being Inappropriate             • As a means of business communication, instant messaging is certainly               less strict than email or written letter. A certain laxity for formal grammar               guidelines, capitalization and the like are accepted.             • However, getting too cute with swapping numbers and abbreviations for               real words is likely to be seen as childish and unprofessional.    3. Ending a Chat             • Be mindful to end an instant message chat by thanking our colleague for               the time or help.             • “Thanks for that. Got a meeting in 10, so need to run. Cheers!”             • There are times, however, when we get interrupted and don’t get a chance               to properly end a chat. Instant messaging is generally accepted as a lower               priority activity when people are forced to choose.             • If someone stops responding to our               conversation in mid-chat, don’t immediately               assume the worst. That person might have               been interrupted by the phone or some other               important activity.    25 PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL                                                                     PROPRIETARY & CONFID                                                                        NFID ENTIAL","Part 1 - Onboarding Documents, Policies and Procedures       4. Professionalism             While you don’t have to start each message like a formal letter, there is still the           expectation of a level of professionalism.           The following are considered unprofessional behaviors when messaging and should be           avoided:                 • Messaging statements you would not read aloud is unprofessional…               • Sending angry IM messages is unprofessional…               • Engaging in Gossip via messaging is unprofessional…               • Making racist or sexist comments or “jokes” is unprofessional…               • Announcing plans to quit or interview for another job via messaging is                      unprofessional…               • Complaining via instant messaging is unprofessional…             The following additional behaviors are considered unprofessional and should be avoided           when using instant messaging.
